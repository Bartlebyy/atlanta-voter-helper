I personally use [My Choices â€” VOTE411 Voter Guide](http://onyourballot.vote411.org/) to find out who am I voting for. I like using this tool since it gives information on statements and experience on each of the candidates.

Another solid choice that I use is Ballotpedia's [sample ballot lookup](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) tool.
