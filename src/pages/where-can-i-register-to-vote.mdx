You go to the Georgia Governmentâ€™s [My Voter Page](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/) to register or find out if you are registered!

To register, just click on the register button on the front page.

Otherwise, if you want to see if you're already registered, just login on the right with the MVP Login to check your status.
