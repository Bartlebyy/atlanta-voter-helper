You can configure all of the site metadata, the categories (name, description,
and image), and of course provide your own articles.

Further, all of the visible text in the theme is customizable.

Check the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center) for
the most up-to-date list of configuration options.
