To request an absentee ballot, you must fill out a pdf form and either email or mail it to your County Board of Registrar Office.

To download a copy of the absentee ballot form go [here](https://sos.ga.gov/admin/files/Absentee%20Ballot%20Fillable%20form%20820.pdf).

To figure out where to mail it, go [here](https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/countyregistrars.do) and find your county email or mailing address.

So for example, since I live in Fulton County, I would email as an attachment, a filled out version of the above pdf to elections.voterregistration@fultoncountyga.gov or I would mail it to 130 PEACHTREE ST SW SUITE 2186 ATLANTA, GA 30303-3460

To verify that they've recieved it, go to the Georgia Governmentâ€™s [My Voter Page](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/), login on the right hand side and click on *Click here for Absentee Ballot status*. Keep in mind it does take a few weeks for them to process and update the website.
