On August 28, 2020, the Secretary of State's office built a [website](https://ballotrequest.sos.ga.gov/) for people to request absentee ballots directly!

“*The website reduces the risk that election officials will [overlook](https://www.ajc.com/politics/investigation-concludes-fulton-failed-to-send-many-absentee-ballots/KS5XW5BP5RCHVHGSSWP7TWM26I/) absentee ballot applications or incorrectly type in voters’ information, problems that surfaced before Georgia’s June 9 primary.*” - [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-launches-paperless-absentee-ballot-request-website/ABFFNDFJQREU3ECQCO52RW5DW4/)

## Other Ways to Request

To request an absentee ballot, you must fill out a PDF form and either email or mail it to your County Board of Registrar Office.

1. To download a copy of the absentee ballot form go [here](https://sos.ga.gov/admin/files/Absentee%20Ballot%20Fillable%20form%20820.pdf).

2. To figure out where to mail it, go [here](https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/countyregistrars.do) and find your county email or mailing address.

    - So for example, since I live in Fulton County, I would send an email to elections.voterregistration@fultoncountyga.gov, with my filled out absentee ballot request form as an attachment, or I would mail it to 130 PEACHTREE ST SW SUITE 2186 ATLANTA, GA 30303-3460


3. To verify that they've recieved it, go to the Georgia Government’s [My Voter Page](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/), login on the right hand side and click on *Click here for Absentee Ballot status*. Keep in mind it does take a few weeks for them to process and update the website.
