In my case, in Fulton county we’re voting for either:
* Fulton County Sheriff:
  * [Ted Jackson](https://www.reelectsherifftjackson.com/) - Our current sheriff of 11+ years who has 32 years of FBI experience.
  * [Patrick Labat](https://www.labatforsheriff.com/) - A Chief Officer who promises to focus on crime reduction, re-entry for criminals and a reevaluation of our use-of force / accountability policies.
* Judge of Superior Court:
  * [Melynee Harris](https://melyneeleftridgeharris.com/) - Served as a judge for 15 years, five of which as a Superior Court Judge. Prior to that, she was an attorney for 17 years.
  * [Tamika Hrobowski-Houston](https://electhrobowskihouston.com/) - Served as an attorney for 26 years and was recognized as a 2020 Georgia Super Lawyer who has experience as a judicial officer.

I personally use [My Choices — VOTE411 Voter Guide](http://onyourballot.vote411.org/) to find out who am I voting for. I like using this tool since it gives information on statements and experience on each of the candidates.

Another solid choice that I use is Ballotpedia's [sample ballot lookup](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) tool.
