To find out on who you'll be voting for, go to Ballotpedia's [sample ballot lookup](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) tool to figure out who's on your ballot.

And I personally like to use [My Choices â€” VOTE411 Voter Guide](http://onyourballot.vote411.org/) as a resource since it gives information on statements and experience on some of the candidates.

_Below are my notes for the candidates who are running in my area of Fulton County._
_I have chosen not to mention any elections with only one option, and I have filtered out some candidates that I believe don't have a chance of winning._

## Ballot Measures

- [Georgia Allow Residents to Seek Declaratory Relief from Certain Laws Amendment (2020)](<https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_Allow_Residents_to_Seek_Declaratory_Relief_from_Certain_Laws_Amendment_(2020)>): This is a Georgia constitutional ammendment, that will allow citizens of Georgia to sue our state and local government if it has been unconsititutional. This has unanimous support from both Democrats and Republicans and no popular counterarguments.
- [Georgia Dedicating Tax and Fee Revenue Amendment (2020)](<https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_Dedicating_Tax_and_Fee_Revenue_Amendment_(2020)>): This is a Georgia constitutional amendment that would give lawmakers the power to say, "That when a fee is for some specified thing, the money has to actually go to it". As an example, a tire tax meant to clean up illegal tire dumps (which has raised more than enough to address this), has reallocated \$50 million to the General Fund, and has not successfully addressed illegal tire dumps. This ammendment has near unanimous support from both Democrats and Republicans and no popular counterarguments.

_As of early September, it looks unlikely that any candidate will get the majority, so there will probably be a runoff election in January between the top two finalists to determine the winner._
