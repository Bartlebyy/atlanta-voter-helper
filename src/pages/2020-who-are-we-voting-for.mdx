To find out on who you'll be voting for, go to Ballotpedia's [sample ballot lookup](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) tool to figure out who's on your ballot.

_Below are my notes for the candidates who are running in my area of Fulton County._
_I have chosen not to mention any elections with only one option, and I have filtered out some candidates that I believe don't have a chance of winning._

## Proposed Constitutional Amendments

1. **Authorizes dedication of fees and taxes to their intended purposes by general state law**

   - This is a Georgia constitutional amendment that would give lawmakers the power to say, "That when a fee is for some specified thing, the money has to actually go to it". As an example, a tire tax meant to clean up illegal tire dumps (which has raised more than enough to address this), has reallocated \$50 million to the General Fund, and has not successfully addressed illegal tire dumps.
   - This ammendment has near unanimous support from both Democrats and Republicans and no popular counterarguments.

2. **Waives state and local sovereign immunity for violation of state laws, state and federal constitutions**

   - This is a Georgia constitutional ammendment, that will allow citizens of Georgia to sue our state and local government if it has been unconsititutional.
   - This has unanimous support from both Democrats and Republicans and no popular counterarguments.
   - Read more about this on [ballotpedia](<https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_Allow_Residents_to_Seek_Declaratory_Relief_from_Certain_Laws_Amendment_(2020)>).

## Statewide Referendum

- ** Establishes a tax exemption for certain real property owned by charities.**
  - Exempty charities like Habitat for Humanity (that help build homes) from having to pay property taxes.
  - This has unanimous support from both Democrats and Republicans and no popular counterarguments.

## Special Election City of Atlanta

- ** City of Atlanta Homestead Exemption**

  - [Voteatl.org](https://www.voteatl.org/city-of-atlanta-independent-school-district-homestead-exemption) did a great job summarizing this.
    - "Voting 'yes' means that homeowners with lower-value homes will pay more in property taxes and homeowners with higher-value homes will pay less in property taxes for the next three years."
    - "Voting 'no' means that there will be no changes in the current tax structure." And Atlanta Public Schools will not lose \$25 million in funding.
