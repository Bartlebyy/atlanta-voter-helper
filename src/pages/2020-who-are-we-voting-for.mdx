I use is Ballotpedia's [sample ballot lookup](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) tool to help me figure out who's on the ballot.

And I like to use [My Choices â€” VOTE411 Voter Guide](http://onyourballot.vote411.org/) since it gives information on statements and experience on each of the candidates.

Later on, I will update this page with details on each of the individual candidates, at least for Fulton County residents.
