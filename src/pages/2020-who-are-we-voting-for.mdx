To find out on who you'll be voting for, go to Ballotpedia's [sample ballot lookup](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) tool to figure out who's on your ballot.

And I personally like to use [My Choices â€” VOTE411 Voter Guide](http://onyourballot.vote411.org/) as a resource since it gives information on statements and experience on some of the candidates.

Later on, as the election gets closer, I will update this page with details on each of the individual candidates for Fulton County residents (since that's where I live and I need to do the research anyway *wink* ).
