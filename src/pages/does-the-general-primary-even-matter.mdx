* Every vote matters!
* A **runoff election** is a second general election conducted to determine which of the top vote-getters in the first general election will be elected to office. Runoffs occur in states that require candidates to receive a majority (as opposed to a plurality) of the vote to win an election.
* Basically it means that itâ€™s a very tight race, with no immediate clear winner. And since turnout for runoffs are typically, much lower than general elections, your vote carries more weight.
