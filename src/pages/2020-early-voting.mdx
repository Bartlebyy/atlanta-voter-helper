- Early voting began on October 12, 2020.
- To search where you can **early vote by county**, see [here](https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/advancedVotingInfo.do).
- For Fulton County, some highlights are you can vote at the High Museum of Art or Ponce de Leon Library. (I'd double check hours)

- For those of you who want to look into **absentee drop box locations** see [here](https://www.ajc.com/politics/where-are-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes-in-metro-atlanta/YWWVPFUDFZF5ZB6JLH5S33UIEU/). (From personal experience it took only a day or two to be accepted, much faster than mailing it in)
